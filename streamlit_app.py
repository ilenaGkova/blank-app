# Step 2: Show the rest of the page

# Layout logistics

# There is a conditional statement. Depending on the number of the st.session_state.page value different assets will be generated.
# Each asset however needs their own quick name to be identified.

# Except page 1 every page needs a valid user to be signed in. Pages 1 and 2 are the only pages that don't require a status to be made by the user and page 6 needs a valid recommendation number.
# The above conditions are initialised in Part B Step 4 every time the page loads.

# From now on any button needs a distinct key, it will be found as the key="XXX" in the button parameters, input fields are the same
# Buttons have other parameters like on_click= XXXXX is the function called when the button is clicked or args = [XXXXX, YYYYY] are the parameters of the function

# Text can be show either by a streamlit option, st.write/header/title... or use html in st.markdown. Both are utilised here.

# Users enter information is text fields, number fields, checkboxes and radio buttons.
# Text fields need to get information when the user presses enter, number fields need limits, checkboxes will return True or False and radio buttons will have a preselected choice unless specified.
# Each type of text input prompt will tell the user what to do to save their answer, thought it might be small in letters.

# Any command st. is a streamlit layout asset. Any command that starts with 'with XXXXX' will put the assets under it in the asset.
# Here that is used to put things in columns and putting things in a square.

# Database collection function
# When a user wants to delete and entry in any collection the Record Collection makes a new entry
# Record Collection keeps other things recorded as well and assigns a letter in an action
# Question Collection records every prompt the user enters as a question
# A tag with the same Recommendation ID, Title and Category will not be entered twice
# Look at the mongo file for more information

# Warning
# The database and the variable names refer to recommendations.
# The texts shown to the user use the word task

# The several pages are separated into files and called under the layout function in each, see files page_{Number} for the notes in each
