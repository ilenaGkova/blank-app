Documentation will be found via 

1. Comments in the code
2. README.txt where all functions and global variables can be found in a tree like structure. Functions/Variables called by an function is seen a tad forward that said function
3. find_your_function.txt has all functions/global variables will tell you everything you need to know: how to call them, parameters required, results, what they do and what safe guards exist. Use README.txt and find_your_function.txt together
